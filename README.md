#### Maintenance Trak 2.0

In this project we explore making a desktop business application to keep track of equipment and events that are scheduled for that equipment. 

The application makes use of the JavaFX GUI Framework as well as the Spring Data Framework. Spring is hosited by the JavaFX application and the functionality of Spring is assisted by the use of FX Weaver.
